=====

Sword is a designer’s best friend.  
It allows to use any kind of preprocessor (SASS/Compass, CoffeeScript, &c.) out-of-the box,  
to emulate real paths and to compile all your result into .zip-archive to upload your result to a server.

Get started
-----------

**Sword** is avaliable as a gem:

gem install sword
```
